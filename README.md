## About
Upper Secondary School graduation project for Sinan Pasic, class 18B, graduate of NTI Gymnasiet, Västerås June 2021.
For use regarding these files, kindly find your way to the license provided in the repository.

This project taught me a great deal of things regarding numerical analysis and applying it from a programmer's perspective.
It was a great deal of fun and one of the most enjoyable and challenging assignments I've ever handled.

## Installation and running
### C
To run the C code, clone the repository into your directory, and compile it using a C compiler, such as GCC.
```c
cd directory
gcc main.c -lm
./a.exe 0.0 10.0 90.0 0.00 -10.0 0.0 1000 > outfile.txt
```
The above code will compile the code using the GCC compiler, and then print out the results of the pendulum's motions and other properties in an outfile.txt
text file, found in the same directory.
